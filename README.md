The 15 puzzle is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1â€“15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.

Half of the starting positions for the n puzzle are impossible to resolve, no matter how many moves are made. 

**The application implements an algorithm that determines whether the position of numbers can be  solved or not**
